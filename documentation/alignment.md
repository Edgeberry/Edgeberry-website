This is the alignment document for the official Edgeberry website (edgeberry.io).



## Concept

### Website type
One-page website with sections.

### Target audience
People with a background in computer science (rather than, for example, industrial automation - who have a need for essentially PLC-like products). So, the story is told from the perspective of "bringing the cloud into the real world".

## Sections

### Hero
The "hero image" is an imagination of connected intelligent machines, strongly inspired by and suggestive of 'sentinels' from The Matrix.

The "Hero text" is an elevator pitch for the Edgeberry project, turning the attention of the visitor into curiosity and interest.

Buzzwords related to intelligent machines, edge computing, IoT, ... etc, so that the website can be indexed in the correct context by search engines.

### Product
After grabbing the user's interest, there's the product section. This section is the "what" in the story the website tells; explaining the visitor what the concrete product is (e.g., the Edgeberry device, Edgeberry Device Hub). The product section should be a short and concise but cristal clear explanation of the product.

Edgeberry is:
- a product in the "Internet of Things" segment of information technology.

#### Key features
- ***A robust (full-blown Linux) computer system*** designed to be build into intelligent machines, with "Powered by Raspberry Pi" as a badge of trust for its robustness and openness
- ***The device hub*** that's the end-point in the cloud.
- ***Hardware Cartridge System*** that allows the user to adapt the device's hardware to its specific purpose.


### Getting Started
After the visitor has a basic understanding of what the product is, there's the "Getting Started" section. This section is the "how" in the story the website tells; explaining the visitor how to get started with the product. This section explains the product's development workflow understandable from the perspective of the target audience. We're trying to instill a feeling of competence ("I can do this!") in the visitor by showing the user that the Edgeberry platform speaks their language; it is an extention of the environment they already know and love.

### Values
The values section explains the values of the Edgeberry project. These values are the foundation of the Edgeberry platform, and are automatically build into products build on top of the Edgeberry platform. This is not only why the visitor should care about the values, but also why the visitor's customers/users/... will care about Edgeberry being in the foundations of their products.

#### Vision
An open source world, where sharing is the default, aimed at collective progress.

- ***self-agency***
- ***open source***: Everything is open source, so that users can study and modify the code to their needs.
- ***repairability***:
