This is the alignment document for the official Edgeberry website (edgeberry.io).

## Concept

### Website type
- One-page website with sections.
- A navbar with links to the sections
- Styling is according to the Edgeberry Brand

### Target audience
People with a background in computer science (rather than, for example, industrial automation - who have a need for essentially PLC-like products). So, the story is told from the perspective of "bringing the cloud into the real world".

(Secondary audience: People who are running a background check on their product, that is based on the Edgeberry platform; looking for confirmation that the product is build on solid foundations - probably mostly in terms of values.)

### Storytelling
The people coming to the website are already curious about the product. We've already captured their attention somehow (Google Search, social media, ... ) and now they got here. This is an opportunity to "sell the idea". The website must speak to the "functional" and "emotional" needs of the visitor. On the one hand clearly explaining the product and its value proposition (rational conclusion that the product is good; the right specs, good developer tools, ...), on the other hand instilling a feeling of competence and self-agency in the visitor (emotional conclusion that the product is good; "Edgeberry believes what I believe"; open source, repairability, ...).

The website is an opportunity for the Edgeberry project's founder to express their vision and sentiments. The founder is very ideology and value driven, and is more interested in selling the idea of the product and its values than in selling the product itself. The website should be a reflection of this.

## Sections

### Hero
The "hero image" is an imagination of connected intelligent machines, strongly inspired by and suggestive of 'sentinels' from The Matrix.

The "Hero text" is an elevator pitch for the Edgeberry project, turning the attention of the visitor into curiosity and interest.

Buzzwords related to intelligent machines, edge computing, IoT, ... etc, so that the website can be indexed in the correct context by search engines.

### Product
After grabbing the user's interest, there's the product section. This section is the "what" in the story the website tells; explaining the visitor what the concrete product is: the Edgeberry device and Edgeberry Device Hub (both components together being more than just the sum of the parts). The product section should be a short and concise but cristal clear explanation of the product.

Edgeberry is:
- a product in the **Internet of Things** segment of information technology; an **IoT platform**.
- full-blown Linux system (for building into your **edge devices**), enabeling distributed **edge computing** capabilities (processing data close to the source, before sending it to the cloud - or autonomous decision making, ... ). Software developmment in familiar ("cloud-native") languages. With "Powered by Raspberry Pi" as a badge of trust for its robustness.
- the computer system is **robust for deployment in the real world** (outside the safety of the server rack/lab). The robustness is visually expressed in the enclosure's design.
- Edgeberry Device Hub can be set up remotely **in the cloud**, as well as on an on-premise **edge server** (e.g., a Raspberry Pi) to act as a **cloud endpoint** for the edge devices


#### Key features
- **A robust (full-blown Linux) computer system** designed to be build into intelligent machines, with "Powered by Raspberry Pi" as a badge of trust for its robustness and openness
- **The device hub** that's the end-point in the cloud.
- **Hardware Cartridge System** that allows the user to adapt the device's hardware to its specific purpose.


### Getting Started
After the visitor has a basic understanding of what the product is, there's the "Getting Started" section. This section is the "how" in the story the website tells; explaining the visitor how to get started with the product. This section explains the product's development workflow understandable from the perspective of the target audience. We're trying to instill a feeling of competence ("I can do this!") in the visitor by showing the user that the Edgeberry platform speaks their language; it is an extention of the environment they already know and love.

### Values
The values section explains the values of the Edgeberry project. These values are the foundation of the Edgeberry platform, and are automatically build into products build on top of the Edgeberry platform. This is not only why the visitor should care about the values, but also why the visitor's customers/users/... will care about Edgeberry being in the foundations of their products. Where possible, show that the Edgeberry "walks the talk"; that the values are not just words, but actions. For example the open source licenses used, ... .

#### Vision
An open source world, where sharing is the default, aimed at collective progress.

- **self-agency**
- **open source**: Everything is open source, so that users can study and modify the code to their needs.
- **repairability**: 
- **activism**: fight the power; counterweight against our current defaults. "With Edgeberry, you too are on the barricades."
